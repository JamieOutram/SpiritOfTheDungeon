# Spirit of The Dungeon
Started out as an ambitious Prototype project to incoperate Machine Learning AI teammates In a RPG Team Managment Dungeon Crawler. 

During development the full scope of Protoyping the ML AI became clear, due to the nature of ML the game mechanics need to be fully functioning and tested before the AI can be trained, otherwise the AI will learn to cheat the game. As a result, at this point in time the project is on hold until I have gained more experience in developing fast but fully functional prototypes.
